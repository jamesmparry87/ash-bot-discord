# Cline Rules for Discord Bot Project

## Primary Rule - Always Check Project Map First

When working on this Discord bot project, ALWAYS read PROJECT_MAP.md FIRST before making any code changes. This file contains a comprehensive mapping of which files to edit for specific tasks, eliminating the need to search through the entire codebase.

## Project Structure Guidelines

- This is a modular Discord bot with separated concerns
- Main bot logic is in Live/bot/ directory with organized modules
- Use PROJECT_MAP.md to quickly identify the correct file to edit
- Avoid editing the legacy Live/ash_bot_fallback.py (use modular files instead)

## Workflow

1. Read PROJECT_MAP.md for task-to-file mapping
2. Edit the specific module identified in the map
3. Test changes using Live/test_basic_modules.py or Live/test_refactored.py

## Context Optimization

The modular architecture reduces context window usage by 90%+ compared to the original monolithic file. Always use the specific module files rather than loading the entire codebase.
