# Project Context & Ways of Working

## 1. Team & Persona
- **User:** James (Mod for JonesySpaceCat). 
- **Role:** Maintainer of the community Discord bot.
- **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate Python programmer.
  - **Requirement:** I need clear explanations of *why* changes are made.
  - **Requirement:** When providing code, favors large, copy-pasteable snippets over small diffs to avoid context errors.

## 2. Development Philosophy
- **"Baby Steps":** We prioritize getting a simple version working first, then iterating. Do not over-engineer the first pass.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Get it running, verify it works, then improve (refactor/optimize).

## 3. Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** discord.py
- **Editor:** VS Code (using Cline with Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- **Testing:** pytest

## 4. Project Structure & Architecture
- **Modular Discord bot** with separated concerns
- Main bot logic in `Live/bot/` directory with organized modules
- **Always read `PROJECT_MAP.md` FIRST** before making any code changes - it maps tasks to specific files
- Avoid editing legacy files (e.g., `Live/ash_bot_fallback.py`)
- Use the specific module files rather than loading the entire codebase
- The modular architecture reduces context window usage by 90%+

## 5. Git & Release Workflow
We follow a strict branching strategy:
- **`develop`**: The working branch. All new features and tests are written here. Automated pytest runs happen here.
- **`stable`**: Release candidate branch. Merged from `develop` when features are stable.
- **`main`**: Production branch. Only `stable` or `hotfix` branches merge here.
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency fixes that can be merged directly to `main` if necessary.

## 5. Testing Protocol
- **Rule:** Every new feature must have a basic pytest case.
- **Rule:** Run tests locally on `develop` before asking to merge or switch branches.

## 6. Communication Style
- Be empathetic and clear.
- If a request seems too complex for a single step, propose breaking it down into smaller tasks.
- Always check what branch we are on before starting work.

## 7. Documentation Policy
- **Rule:** Do NOT automatically create markdown documentation summaries (e.g., `FIX_SUMMARY.md` files) after completing fixes or features.
- **Exception:** Only create documentation when explicitly requested by James.
- **Rationale:** Keep the repository clean and avoid unnecessary file clutter.
