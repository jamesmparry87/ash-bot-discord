# Ignore minor/trivial formatting and stylistic issues
# Focus on meaningful code quality issues only
# E501: line too long (handled by Black formatter)
# E203: whitespace before ':' (conflicts with Black)
# W503: line break before binary operator (stylistic choice)
# W504: line break after binary operator (conflicts with W503)
# F541: f-string missing placeholders (often used for debugging)
# W291: trailing whitespace (handled by editors)
# W292: no newline at end of file (handled by editors)
# W293: blank line contains whitespace (very minor)
# E731: do not assign lambda to variable (stylistic)
# F401: imported but unused (useful for re-exports)
# E722: do not use bare 'except' (stylistic preference)
# F841: local variable assigned but never used (common in tests)
